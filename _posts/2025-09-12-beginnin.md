Sometimes, what is __dificult__ is, in fact, only __not tried yet__. That is why we should always strive to push our limits, to walk that extra mile from our former selves to our new possibilities.
But a question arises.
What are the selves that we want? We could say that the new is already in us as a _potentiality_, but this could mean that we are _everything_ , which, actually, means that we are nothing.
Thus, may we should reflect first of what we already _are_ in order to better understand what we should really _become_.
This is an ancient thought. It may inspire us for choosing from the multifarious deluge of information, which, in fact, is just attention hijacking. What we lack is a model of humanity that could guide us, regardless of the continuous technological advances. Talking instead of recording ourselves or texting, touching instead of writing emojis, crying instead of uploading images with lit candles, walking insteand of checking on Google Maps.
Nevertheless, all this could be frustrating and, even worse, useless. Because the purpose of such ludite atitude is none other than _trying to prove_ that we refuse the digital environment, but it fails to replace this offer with a substantial lifestyle, with a workable definition of what a human being should be. 
We could admit that _too much_ digital is detrimental for our lives, but that does not say anything about what our lives should _look like_.
