# Time is not composed of moments, but of chances.
~~Now or never!~~ This cliche is actually more important than we admit, because, even though we do not realize, our lives are full of crossroads like that. We do not know how time passes, how we waste our opportunities. 
### *Fugit irreparabile tempus*.

This old adage is actually incomplete. **Tempus** means not only **time** as a series of moments, but also means chance to change. That is why the ancient Greeks differentiated between *kairos* and *chronos*. First was opportunity, the *right* time to do something. The second was just a moment like every other one.  
So, please, do not forget:
